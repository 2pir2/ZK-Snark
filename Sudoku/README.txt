Thanks for the help from ivokub.

This example simulates the interactions between prover and verifier --- prover generates a proof and vk and sends to verifier for verification process.

In order to run the code, first navigate to prover.go, use commmand --- go run prover.go --- to generate the prove and vk files. Copy paste those two files to verifier folder.

Under verifier directory, use the command --- go run verifier.go --- to verify the proof.
